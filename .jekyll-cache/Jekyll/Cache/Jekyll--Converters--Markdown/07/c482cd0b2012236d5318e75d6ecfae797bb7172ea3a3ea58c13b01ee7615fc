<p>Hi, My name is <strong>Waseem Akram</strong> a.k.a <strong>n0nu11</strong>. I make web apps, mobile apps, hunt bugs and design a little bit of user interfaces.
Well, Iâ€™m here to share you the wonderful but boring story of mine on how i got introduced to programming and making stuffs i like and much more. so Get ready with the time machine, because we are going to travel back and forth in time. Lets go way back in time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a computer enthusiast since my childhood. i like to play and break computers, explore unkown realm of computer world. Since then iâ€™ve been curious how these magic boxes (computers) works. But a bummer, all i had is a mediocre desktop with limited and bad internet connection (Internet wasâ€™nt that famous those days). i started learning how basic components like printers, scanners, modems, etc,. works. Also i broke a lot of things from software (Operating systems by misconfiguration) to hardware in the way of exploration. Thanks to my dad for getting it fixed everytime.</p>

<p><em>Nothing interesting here. lets go a little forward in time now.</em></p>

<p>Weâ€™re here in 2012. Iâ€™m now a 13 year old calling myself a geek ðŸ˜†, because that was the time i owned my first android phone, a old little micromax touch phone. Iâ€™ve used phones before, obviously an android but that belongs to my parents so i didnâ€™t have much freedom to explore and break things. When i got my own phone, things started rigoring. iâ€™ve learned a lot about android, iphones, their models and specs. i started tweaking around the android and installing various launchers to customise it the way i want. One fine day, i got introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)">rooting</a> and you wouldâ€™ve expect it. I Rooted my phone ignoring those scary warnings about the security issues and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)">bricking</a> problems. Since then it changed the way i look at technology, How manufactures restrict users and how rooting breaks out the restriction and allows freedom to customise it in kernel level. Also that was the first time i got introduced to the term <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hacking</code></strong>. I installed a lot of tweaks, apps and patched games,etc, i pretty much enjoyed the process of rooting, the thrill of rooting (because if i brick, all i had to do is throw it away or spend some lump money to fix which will never be an option for me) and the benefits i gained after rooting. Apart from geeky stuffs i did Photoshop, Video editing using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Vision">nero vision</a>.</p>

<p>Huh! Its 2014. Iâ€™m 15 now, usual studies and exams bored me as always. One fine day, My dad bought me an iPhone 4, thats the first iPhone i had. That small incredible device is an masterpiece (Thanks to Steve jobs). The speed, smoothness and camera quality blew my mind. I loved every moment with it. Well time passed, you wouldâ€™ve guessed it by now, <strong>ITS TIME TO JAILBREAK!!!</strong> (Jailbreak is similiar to rooting). Again i started enjoying the benefits and freedom of tweaking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There wasnâ€™t a bluetooth file transfer feature in iPhone. Installed a tweak, Got it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No file manager? no problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need some points or money in games? no problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download movies and music directly to iTunes? no problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Jailbreak was like a buff for iPhone. Features are not just an imagination on those days. Then i got to know about <strong>SIRI</strong>. Who didnâ€™t want a talking smart assistant on their phone? But siri wasnâ€™t natively available for iPhone 4. well lets install the SIRI using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydia">cydia</a> (its a package manager where you can install jailbreak tweaks) then. Lets risk it, what could go wrong right? fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž.</p>

<p>Something went wrong with installation or dependencies i think, or it wasnâ€™t just built for the iPhone 4.</p>

<p>My incredible iPhone got bricked ðŸ˜­</p>

<p>This is one of the most regretting moment in my life.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHGnY8oB4BHVTP2/giphy.gif" alt="regret" /></p>

<p>I could have just fixed it by formatting everything back to normal but internet was expensive those days and the firmware files was more than a gigs in size. No problem lets fix it.</p>

<p>Bought the internet pack and started downloading firmware files. <strong>Fingers crossed again ðŸ¤ž.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKWzRShjaQxMGCk/giphy.gif" alt="Download stuck" /></p>

<p><strong>99% and FAILED!!!</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3V0DBUt0chMCKBKo/giphy.gif" alt="Fail" /></p>

<p>I canâ€™t afford an another data pack. so i just gave up. Bye Bye iPhone ðŸ˜¢</p>

<p><em>Sad times. lets get goingâ€¦</em></p>

<p>Its Year 2015, 16 year old playing with android. Yeah iâ€™m back to android after i messed up my iPhone. since then i had many android phones changed but in every android phone that i ever owned i did the same thing which is far from rooting. This time i started playing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions">Android roms</a> (Android roms are just modified android os) and different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernels</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">bootloaders</a>, recovery images,etc., available for the specific device i had. I would change the android rom as frequently as 2-3 per week just because it is fun to do. Basically i was addicted to that for a long time. I didnâ€™t want to stay there but i wanted to learn how the operating system works. Thats how i got introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Linux</code></a>. I was a beginner and a windows user, so linux is scary as well as fun for the first time. Out of curiosity i learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash Scripting</a> and made <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/mod-intelli-tweaks-t3159308">Intelli Tweaks</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Intelli tweaks</strong> is, as the name suggests, Its tweaking script for rooted android phones which will buff your phoneâ€™s performance; You may have to take a look what it can do and make sure you read the comments too ðŸ˜…. To be honest, i copied a few features from others and added to mine and made my tweaks look unique.</p>

<p><em>Thats the first ever <strong>code/project</strong> i ever wrote. <strong>Proud Moment</strong></em> ðŸŽ‰</p>
