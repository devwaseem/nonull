## Whoami

Hi, My name is __Waseem Akram__ a.k.a **n0nu11**. I make web apps, mobile apps, hunt bugs and design a little bit of user interfaces.
Well, I'm here to share you the wonderful but boring story of mine on how i got introduced to programming and making stuffs i like and much more. So get ready with the time machine, because we are going to travel back and forth in time. Lets go way back in time.

## Journey to the center of my childhood

![time machine](https://media.giphy.com/media/kxAX99ncvbPk4/giphy.gif)

I've been a computer enthusiast since my childhood. i like to play and break computers, explore unkown realm of computer world. Since then i've been curious how these magic boxes (computers) works. But a bummer, all i had is a mediocre desktop with limited and bad internet connection (Internet was'nt that famous those days). i started learning how basic components like printers, scanners, modems, etc,. works. Also i broke a lot of things from software (Operating systems by misconfiguration) to hardware in the way of exploration. Thanks to my dad for getting it fixed everytime.

_Nothing interesting here. lets go a little forward in time now._

## Geek! Not Nerd!!

![geek](https://media.giphy.com/media/s5u4GijpxgG4M/giphy.gif)

We're here in 2012. I'm now a 13 year old calling myself a geek 😆, because that was the time i owned my first android phone, a old little micromax touch phone. I've used phones before, obviously an android but that belongs to my parents so i didn't have much freedom to explore and break things. When i got my own phone, things started rigoring. i've learned a lot about android, iphones, their models and specs. i started tweaking around the android and installing various launchers to customise it the way i want. One fine day, i got introduced to [rooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)) and you would've expect it. I Rooted my phone ignoring those scary warnings about the security issues and [bricking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)) problems. Since then it changed the way i look at technology, How manufactures restrict users and how rooting breaks out the restriction and allows freedom to customise it in kernel level. Also that was the first time i got introduced to the term **`Hacking`**. I installed a lot of tweaks, apps and patched games,etc, i pretty much enjoyed the process of rooting, the thrill of rooting (because if i brick, all i had to do is throw it away or spend some lump money to fix which will never be an option for me) and the benefits i gained after rooting. Apart from geeky stuffs i did Photoshop, Video editing using [nero vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Vision).

## The Siri tragic

![siri](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTkcERIlUQywNbOlYA/giphy.gif)

Huh! Its 2014. I'm 15 now, usual studies and exams bored me as always. One fine day, My dad bought me an iPhone 4, thats the first iPhone i had. That small incredible device is an masterpiece (Thanks to Steve jobs). The speed, smoothness and camera quality blew my mind. I loved every moment with it. Well time passed, you would've guessed it by now, **ITS TIME TO JAILBREAK!!!** (Jailbreak is similiar to rooting). Again i started enjoying the benefits and freedom of tweaking.

- There wasn't a bluetooth file transfer feature in iPhone. Installed a tweak, Got it.
  
- No file manager? no problem.
  
- Need some points or money in games? no problem.
  
- Download movies and music directly to iTunes? no problem.
  
Jailbreak was like a buff for iPhone. Features are not just an imagination on those days. Then i got to know about **SIRI**. Who didn't want a talking smart assistant on their phone? But siri wasn't natively available for iPhone 4. well lets install the SIRI using [cydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydia) (its a package manager where you can install jailbreak tweaks) then. Lets risk it, what could go wrong right? fingers crossed 🤞.

Something went wrong with installation or dependencies i think, or it wasn't just built for the iPhone 4.

My incredible iPhone got bricked 😭

This is one of the most regretting moment in my life.

![regret](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHGnY8oB4BHVTP2/giphy.gif)

I could have just fixed it by formatting everything back to normal but internet was expensive those days and the firmware files was more than a gigs in size. No problem lets fix it.

Bought the internet pack and started downloading firmware files. **Fingers crossed again 🤞.**

![Download stuck](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKWzRShjaQxMGCk/giphy.gif)

**99% and FAILED!!!**

![Fail](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3V0DBUt0chMCKBKo/giphy.gif)

I can't afford an another data pack. so i just gave up. Bye Bye iPhone 😢

_Sad times. lets get going..._

## The Game of Roms

![GOT](https://media.giphy.com/media/iwVHUKnyvZKEg/giphy.gif)

Its Year 2015, 16 year old playing with android. Yeah i'm back to android after i messed up my iPhone. since then i had many android phones changed but in every android phone that i ever owned i did the same thing which is far from rooting. This time i started playing with the [Android roms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions) (Android roms are just modified android os) and different [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)), [bootloaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting), recovery images,etc., available for the specific device i had. I would change the android rom as frequently as 2-3 per week just because it is fun to do. Basically i was addicted to that for a long time. I didn't want to stay there but i wanted to learn how the operating system works. Thats how i got introduced to [`Linux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). I was a beginner and a windows user, so linux is scary as well as fun for the first time. Out of curiosity i learned [Bash Scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and made [Intelli Tweaks](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/mod-intelli-tweaks-t3159308).

<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/mod-intelli-tweaks-t3159308" >Click here to check it out</a>

**Intelli tweaks** is, as the name suggests, Its tweaking script for rooted android phones which will buff your phone's performance; You may have to take a look what it can do and make sure you read the comments too 😅. To be honest, i copied a few features from others and added to mine and made my tweaks look unique.

_Thats the first ever **code/project** i ever wrote. **Proud Moment**_ 🎉

## Programming in computerland

![alice in wonderland](https://media.giphy.com/media/38NNXN3e9ThTi/giphy.gif)

We are in 2016. The year where it all actually started. Time to choose a major branch in my highschool. I'm a science lover so i had 2 choices: either take biology or computer science as major. i assumed that computer science major will be just a waste of time since i know the basics 🤨. why do i have to learn how to reinvent the wheel? when i already know how the wheel works?!. So i chose Biology branch.

_Soon i've realised i made a mistake_

_Another regretting moment..._
