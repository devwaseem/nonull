      <content type="text"><![CDATA[WhoamiHi, My name is Waseem Akram a.k.a n0nu11. I make web apps, mobile apps, hunt bugs and design a little bit of user interfaces.Well, Iâ€™m here to share you the wonderful but boring story of mine on how i got introduced to programming and making stuffs i like and much more. so Get ready with the time machine, because we are going to travel back and forth in time. Lets go way back in time.Journey to the center of my childhoodIâ€™ve been a computer enthusiast since my childhood. i like to play and break computers, explore unkown realm of computer world. Since then iâ€™ve been curious how these magic boxes (computers) works. But a bummer, all i had is a mediocre desktop with limited and bad internet connection (Internet wasâ€™nt that famous those days). i started learning how basic components like printers, scanners, modems, etc,. works. Also i broke a lot of things from software (Operating systems by misconfiguration) to hardware in the way of exploration. Thanks to my dad for getting it fixed everytime.Nothing interesting here. lets go a little forward in time now.Geek! Not Nerd!!Weâ€™re here in 2012. Iâ€™m now a 13 year old calling myself a geek ðŸ˜†, because that was the time i owned my first android phone, a old little micromax touch phone. Iâ€™ve used phones before, obviously an android but that belongs to my parents so i didnâ€™t have much freedom to explore and break things. When i got my own phone, things started rigoring. iâ€™ve learned a lot about android, iphones, their models and specs. i started tweaking around the android and installing various launchers to customise it the way i want. One fine day, i got introduced to rooting and you wouldâ€™ve expect it. I Rooted my phone ignoring those scary warnings about the security issues and bricking problems. Since then it changed the way i look at technology, How manufactures restrict users and how rooting breaks out the restriction and allows freedom to customise it in kernel level. Also that was the first time i got introduced to the term Hacking. I installed a lot of tweaks, apps and patched games,etc, i pretty much enjoyed the process of rooting, the thrill of rooting (because if i brick, all i had to do is throw it away or spend some lump money to fix which will never be an option for me) and the benefits i gained after rooting. Apart from geeky stuffs i did Photoshop, Video editing using nero vision.Lets leave. come on get in the time machineâ€¦The Siri tragicHuh! Its 2014. Iâ€™m 15 now, usual studies and exams bored me as always. One fine day, My dad bought me an iPhone 4, thats the first iPhone i had. That small incredible device is an masterpiece (Thanks to Steve jobs). The speed, smoothness and camera quality blew my mind. I loved every moment with it. Well time passed, you wouldâ€™ve guessed it by now, ITS TIME TO JAILBREAK!!! (Jailbreak is similiar to rooting). Again i started enjoying the benefits and freedom of tweaking.      There wasnâ€™t a bluetooth file transfer feature in iPhone. Installed a tweak, Got it.        No file manager? no problem.        Need some points or money in games? no problem.        Download movies and music directly to iTunes? no problem.  Jailbreak was like a buff for iPhone. Features are not just an imagination on those days. Then i got to know about SIRI. Who didnâ€™t want a talking smart assistant on their phone? But siri wasnâ€™t natively available for iPhone 4. well lets install the SIRI using cydia (its a package manager where you can install jailbreak tweaks) then. Lets risk it, what could go wrong right? fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž.Something went wrong with installation or dependencies i think, or it wasnâ€™t just built for the iPhone 4.My incredible iPhone got bricked ðŸ˜­This is one of the most regretting moment in my life.I could have just fixed it by formatting everything back to normal but internet was expensive those days and the firmware files was more than a gigs in size. No problem lets fix it.Bought the internet pack and started downloading firmware files. Fingers crossed again ðŸ¤ž.99% and FAILED!!!I canâ€™t afford an another data pack. so i just gave up. Bye Bye iPhone ðŸ˜¢Sad times. lets get goingâ€¦The Game of RomsIts Year 2015, 16 year old playing with android. Yeah iâ€™m back to android after i messed up my iPhone. since then i had many android phones changed but in all that i did the same thing which is apart from rooting. This time i started playing with the Android roms (Android roms are just modified android os) and different kernels available for the specific device i had. Thats when i got introduced to Linux. I was a beginner and a windows user, so linux is scary as well as fun for the first time. Out of curiosity i learned Bash Scripting and made Intelli Tweaks. Intelli tweaks is as the name suggests, Its tweaking script for rooted android phones which will buff your phoneâ€™s performance.Programming and the computerland]]></content>
